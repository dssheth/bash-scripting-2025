# 16 July 2025 Report - Day 52 - Brief 

## Content
Today I worked on the project to find whether the gene GPRC6A is present is bovines or lost. I worked with the other intern and did the BLAST for 3-4 bovine organsisms like sheep, goat and human gene as reference gene and checked for the alignment and submitted the genes, exon length, chromosome number report to the PhD student working on it and disussed with her for the further work. Read the papers thoroughly and looked at the pipelines followed in both the papers we are reading.
