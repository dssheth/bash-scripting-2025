# 17 July 2025 Report - Day 53 - Brief 

## Content
Today I worked on doing BLAST on cow and birds species with human exons as reference. We also had discussion with PI about further work and what are the ways we can figure out the way the gene is present or lost. Then also tried to find what other ways can be done and read the papers more by focusing more. The task to find the antibody of the paralog of gene. Learnt a lot about the work of bioinformatcis and using the tools. I also read about the chapter-10 further. Also made the notes for chapter-9.
