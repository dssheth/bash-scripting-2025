# 08 July 2025 Report - Day 44 - Brief

## Content

Today I practiced the commands and tried all the options of commands. Made the notes for video. Started with chapter-9 and read the introduction.
I explored how to code in bash and write shell scripts and made some small projects like prompt a user and then use `read` and `wait` in scripts. Checked the jobs working foreground and background and to kill the process and more.
