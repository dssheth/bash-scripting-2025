# 18 July 2025 Report - Day 54 - Bash Administration

## Content

Today I read the research papers and did the BLAST of cow genome with human gene as reference. Then I completed the chapter-10 and the topics learnt are:

1. Environment customization: umask

2. ulimit

3. Types of global customization

Some of the commands learnt are:

1. `ulimit` syntax
```bash
ulimit [options] [limit_value]
```

2. To view all current limits
```bash
ulimit -a
```
