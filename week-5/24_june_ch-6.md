# 24 June 2025 Report - Day 30 - Commmand-line options and typed variables

## Content

Today I made the video for week and continued with the chapter-6. The topics I learnt today are:

1. Typed Variables

2. Integer variables and arithmetic

3. Arithmetic variables and assignment

4. Arithmetic for loops


The commands learned are:

1. *`declare`* command: gives the variable a specific type or attribute.
```bash
declare [OPTION] variable=value
```
