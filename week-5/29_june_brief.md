# 29 June 2025 Report - Day 35 - Brief

## Content

Today I made the video of chapter-6 and along with that I learned a lot of concepts from it like the sorting and bubble sort with using the arrays.
I worked on the project a bit to learn the bash scripting properly and understand the concepts. I also starting with the chapter-7 about Input/Output and command line processing. I learnt the introduction and the I/O redirectors. There are different types of redirectors but few are used majorly and some are used only in specific tasks.

Some of the I/O redirectors are:
```bash
# Direct StdOut to file
> file 

# Direct StdOut to file or append if already exists
>>file

# Take StdIn from file
<file

# Force StdOut to file even if noclobber is set
>|file

# Use file as both Standard I/O
<>file

# Close StdOut
>&-

# Close StdIn
<&-
```
