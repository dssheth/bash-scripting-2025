# 03 July 2025 Report - Day 39 - I/O and Command-Line Processing

## Content

Today I read about different commands in bash scripting. Explored how bash scripting is used in projects. I completed the chapter-7 and learnt about the topics:

1. Command-Line Processing :    
Have 12 steps to run in command line. 

2. Quoting :    
To skip some of the 12 steps in shell.

3. command, builtin and enable :    
To change the command lookup order.

4. eval  and make command :     
To undergo all the 12 steps again from start.

The commands learnt and practiced are:  

1. command options
```bash
command -p commandname [args]
command -v commandname [args]
```

2. `eval` command: run through all the command processing steps again.
```bash 
eval command 
```
