# 30 June 2025 Report - Day 36 - I/O and Command-Line Processing

## Content

Today I uploaded the video for chapter-6 on classroom. Continued with the chapter-7 learning, I covered the topics:

1. Here-Documents

2. File Descriptors

3. String I/O: echo

Some Commands learned are:

1. Syntax for Here-Documents

```bash
command << label
Here-document: The input
label
```

2. Some File descriptors

```bash
#reading input or giving output to multiple files at the same time
<& n
```

3. `echo` commands and options

```bash
echo

#interpret backslash-escaped characters turned on
echo -e

# turn off the interpretation- default
echo -E

# Omit the final new line
echo -n
```
