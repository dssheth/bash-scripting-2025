# 16 June 2025 Report - Day 22 - Brief

## Content

Today I practiced the chapter 4 commands with other different types of examples to understand it thoroughly. I created the ortholog files for other programs like BLAT, LAST and UBLAST and then tried to do the statistics and understood the concepts. Then I compared the results with BLAST.
I also edited the video a bit and will upload tomorrow for chapter-4.s
