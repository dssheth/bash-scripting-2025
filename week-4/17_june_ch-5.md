# 17 June 2025 Report - Day 23 - Flow Control

## Content

Today I uploaded the video-3 that includes chapter-4. Also I started with chapter-5 "Flow Control". The concepts I learnt about are:

1. Flow Control:  
   Control the flow of program's execution.

2. Different types of conditions for flow control

3. if/else condition  
   Syntax:

```bash
if condition
then
statements
[elif condition
then statements...]
[else
statements]
fi
```

4. Exit status  
   0 is usually the OK exit status, while anything else usually denotes an error.
