# 12 June 2025 Report - Day 18 - Brief

## Content

Today I created the Database in BLAST with the Homo sapiens and Gallus gallus that is human and chicken coding sequences. Thecon created results file of Reciprocal Best Hits of both human sequence as query and chicken sequence as subject and vice versa with chicken vs human. Then found out orthologs from those sequence. Used bash commands and python codes for the work. Learned about Biopython library for the using in this work.

Created notes and content for the video of this week. Practiced chapter 4 commands and functions.
