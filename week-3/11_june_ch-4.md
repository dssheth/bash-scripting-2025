# 10 June 2025 Report - Day 16 - Basic Shell Programming

## Content

Today I read the whole research paper again and made a review from it as permy understanding. I installed set up the BLAST in the system. Further work in related with that paper was discussed with the prof. Learned a bit about how to run BLAST and see the results. 

I practiced the basic shell programming with some basic commands and writing functions. Checked to write scripts. Read initial part of chapter-5.
