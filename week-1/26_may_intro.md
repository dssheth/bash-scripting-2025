# 26 May 2025 Report - Day 1 - Introduction to bash scripting

## Introduction

Hello, I am Dhruvi Sheth. I joined the google classroom today and so I am starting my day with the first chapter of the learning bash book. This is my first day of logging today's work.

## Content

I began by learning the chapter 1 of the book "Bash Basics".
The topics which I explored today was:

1. Introduction to bash and shell

2. bash scripting history

3. Features of bash

4. Commands, arguments and options

5. Files, Directories and Tilde Notations

6. Some of the commands used in command line

Some of the commands I learnt regarding the same are:

1. `ls` command: This command is used to see the contents of current repository.

```bash
ls
```

2. `cd` command: This command is used to change the working directory

```bash
cd
```

3. `pwd` command: This command prints the current working directory

```bash
pwd
```
