# 25 July 2025 Report - Day 61 GPRC6A Brief

## Content

Today I created one script in which multiple files of a folder can be run at a time and run the codon highlighter script. So I checked for different species near bos taurus in bovinae with their CDS in the tool and found all of them have pre-mature stop codons in the gene sequence. I also checked the bos taurus and homo sapiens cds sequence alignment with clustalo and emboss needle tools online and found that there is pre mature stop codon in bos taurus not found in the homo sapien sequence. The gene GPRC6A is shown to be present at chromosome 9 but need to check the functionality and expression. The expression was shown only in salivary gland when checked in the expression on the NCBI website for gene.
