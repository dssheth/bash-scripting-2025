# 26 July 2025 Report - Day 62 - GPRC6A Brief

## Content

Today I worked on finding the stop codons in other species as well in the phylogenetic tree near the bos taurus like bos indicus, bos mutus and also other gneus bubalus bubalis. Using the tool made to find the stop codons, I found that all of them have in-frame stop codons in the CDS sequence. Also made improvement in the tool. Looked further at the pipeline followed in the research paper to find the gene loss.
