# 21 July 2025 Report - Day 57 - Brief

## Content

Today I checked for the epitope sequence of the CaSR from the antibody founded on the Citeab platform. I also found the protein sequences of GPRC6A gene and paralog CaSR of both bovine and human. Then using the Emboss Needle option, aligned both the protein sequences and found the identity and similarity percentage of the sequences by matching with each other. From Citeab, the antibody sequences found from uniprot website and download the json file including the whole sequence and the different epitope sequences with the description. Now I need to find the sequences in the CaSR sequence in bovine. Discussed all the things with PI and now given a paper to read to get a solution for the main issue of finding the  presence of gene in bovine.
