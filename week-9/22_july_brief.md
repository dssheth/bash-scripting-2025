# 22 July 2025 Report - Day 58 - Brief

## Content

Today I read the research paper about loss of hunger hormone "ghrelin" in passerine birds and looked at the pipeline to conclude the gene loss.
Made the notes of pipeline and checked to follow to find the loss of gene "GPRC6A" in bovines (specifically bos taurus).
First downloaded the cds, protein, exon sequences of human gprc6a gene as reference gene sequences. Also downloaded the subject bos taurus cds, protein sequences. Then did the blastn with the bos taurus genome and the exons of human (after removing utrs) and checked the alignment.
