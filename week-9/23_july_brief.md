## Content

Today I did the tblastx and tblastn with the bos taurus genome and human protein and cds sequences as reference and checked the alignment and found tha the chromosome 9 shows lowest E-value tending to 0 and higher identity of gene. Looked at all the sequences and shows different chromosomes with alignement and found chromosome9 to be the most identical and closest but need to check the sequence alignment in exons and the frame of sequences.
